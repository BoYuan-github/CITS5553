# CITS5553
This repository involves datasets and the code files of machine learning models.
The decision tree and support vector regression are used for machine leaning models.

The output tree stucture from decision tree presents features by X[0]Crime_type; X[1]Month;	X[2]AvgMinTemp;	X[3]AvgMaxTemp;	X[4]AvgDailyRainfall;	X[5]Latitude;	X[6]Longitude

The data file 'new_data_with_temp.csv' are produced by code in 'Data_integration&preparation.ipynb', which are used as traning data for all machine learing models in the project.
